# The Green Thumb

A project that we had to make on one week, using PHP, a database and some API of our choice.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A software to run a PHP server with a SQL database. An authentification key to use Trefle.io API.

```
MAMP
WAMP
XAMP
```

### Installing

Copy the project in the server file (htdocs in MAMP), copy the .sql export to your database, modify the URL in index.php to make it point to your file, configure the access to your database, and modify all the API config files by entering your keys.

## Deployment

Make the same process than before, but on your real server.

## Built With
